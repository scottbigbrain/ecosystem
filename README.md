# Hexagon based Ecosystem
This is an ecosystem simulation that was done for a biology project. It includes 4 organisms: Grass, Mice, Rabbits, and Hawks.

Be aware that the GameZero.jl module I am using for graphics is a custom version. To use, run
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/scottbigbrain/GameZero.jl")
```
